The code depends on: 

- numpy 
- pytorch 
- matplotlib
- torchbnn 
- torchview 
- pandas 
- matplotlib 

It has been tested with python 3.12.1

## Usage

The project is split into multiple files:

- `BNN_NN_comparison.ipynb` contains code for regression on custom data 
- `hpp.ipynb` contains code for Housing Price Prediction 
- `iris.ipynb` contains code for IRIS dataset
- `mnist.ipynb` contains code for the MNIST dataset

To run `hpp.ipynb`, download model `hpp.pt` from the `Model` folder in [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hzCnDRC2WAYM0QXLDCyrb561c68_ZQ5a) link. Download `train.csv` from `Dataset` folder in the same link. 

To run `mnist.ipynb`, download model `mnist.pt` from the `Model` folder in the same link.
